(As per course outline) A vast number of models arising in Machine Learning, in particular, and Data Science, in general, possess a level of complexity which renders their solution intractable by analytical methods. This course will expose students to a number of numerical techniques which have proven to be highly successful in the task of obtaining solutions to such models. The topics covered will include both deterministic and non-deterministic methodologies.
